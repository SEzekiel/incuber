#About Incuber
Incuber is is a simple app that is supposed to help you tell the Ashesi community that you are coming to campus with an uber. Someone who wants to leave the campus with an Uber can then contact the driver. Let's end email and inefficient WhatsApp messages by using Incuber.
#How it works
There are just two actions that canbe performed. If you are coming to campus with an Uber, go to the home page and tap on 'Notify'. You will be prompted to enter some simple info. Click on notify and the data will be stored.
If you want to check if there are any Ubers coming to campus, from the homepage, click on 'view' and a list of stored Uberdrivers will be displayed (if there are any).
#Developers
This project is completely open source. Feel free to contribute and make it better and bigger. If you have any questions let me know
#Privacy
This app collects basic personal info like name and phone number. It is usually good courtesy to inform Uber drivers before sending their details. NOTE that all details have a life time of 1 hour, hence, they are deleted after one hour of being posted.
