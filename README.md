<h2>About Incuber</h2><br>
Incuber is is a simple app that is supposed to help you tell the Ashesi community that you are coming to campus with an uber. Someone who wants to leave the campus with an Uber can then contact the driver. Let's end email and inefficient WhatsApp messages by using Incuber.
<h2>How it works</h2>
There are just two actions that canbe performed. If you are coming to campus with an Uber, go to the home page and tap on 'Notify'. You will be prompted to enter some simple info. Click on notify and the data will be stored.
If you want to check if there are any Ubers coming to campus, from the homepage, click on 'view' and a list of stored Uberdrivers will be displayed (if there are any).
NOTE: this app for the Ashesi community. If you are not a member of the Ashesi community, please do not attempt to contribute
<h2>Developers</h2>
This project is completely open source. Feel free to contribute and make it better and bigger. If you have any questions let me know. The database connection file is not included in the repository for obvious reasons. Feel free provide your own hook to test your own verson of this application. The database schema is included to help you do this
<h2>Privacy</h2>
This app collects basic personal info like name and phone number. It is usually good courtesy to inform Uber drivers before sending their details. NOTE that all details are stored for as long as you specify int the 'Aprx time to arrive' field in the notification form and are automatically deleted after that time expires.
